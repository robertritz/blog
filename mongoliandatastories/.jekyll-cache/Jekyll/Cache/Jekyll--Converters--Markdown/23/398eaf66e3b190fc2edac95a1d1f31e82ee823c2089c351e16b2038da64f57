I"o<p>As 2021 ends, I’m reflecting on all the changes I’ve seen since I moved to Mongolia in 2012. As I’ve thought beyond the KFC’s, the CU’s, the new malls, and other surface level “developments”, I’ve been thinking of larger questions. One of the bigger of these large questions is a simple one, are Mongolians making more money than they used to?</p>

I"ó<p>Since moving to Ulaanbaatar in 2013, Iâ€™ve been to nearly every market in the city. I was struck by the opposite worlds of the zakh and the supermarket. One feels bustling but is arguably less convenient (no carts, very little parking). The other is more structured and has more packaged products but is often lacking in the selection of fresh foods. In some ways itâ€™s indicative of the dichotomy that exists in Ulaanbaatar in general between the new and the old, the urban and periurban.</p>
